tq - thymoquinone , mpp - 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium summary of the neuroprotective effect of tq against mpp treatment in primary mesencephalic cell culture .
in the present study , tq was investigated to ascertain whether it protected mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons against mpp - induced cell death through activation of enzymatic degradation , preservation of mitochondrial function , and inhibition of apoptotic cell death .
clearly , mpp was found to significantly decrease the survival of dopaminergic neurons and increase the release of ldh into the culture medium .
the mpp toxicity involves its selective uptake by dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i activity with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization.14 in parallel , the use of jc-1 fluorescence dye in our current study showed that mpp significantly decreased the m of cultured cells as indicated by the decreasing red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 .
similar mpp - induced reduction of m was reported in other in vitro disease models.15,16 mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both pd patients and experimental models.17,18 staining of primary dopaminergic cultures with blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain showed that a significant number of the cells displayed features of apoptosis , most notably chromatin condensation , and fragmentation .
previously , tang et al19 and xu et al16 demonstrated that mpp caused apoptotic cell death in pc12 and sh - sy5y cells .
the mpp - induced apoptosis was reported to occur as the result of disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore.20 similar to our previous report,9 co - treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with tq and mpp was found to protect dopaminergic neurons and decreased the release of ldh into the culture medium . since that time , no evidence in the literature has shown how tq protected dopaminergic neurons in the primary mesencephalic cell culture .
staining of cultures with lysotracker deep red showed that tq significantly increased the red fluorescence of the dye compared with mpp - treated cultures , indicating enhancement of the formation of many autophagolysosomes , the sites of lysosomal degradation , by tq .
this is supported by the findings of he and klionsky21 who correlated the fluorescent signals of lysotracker deep red to the upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish . increased red fluorescence of lysotracker deep red
is attributed to the formation of many autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes that retain much dye as the result of increasing their acidification . using jc-1 fluorescent dye showed that tq significantly enhanced m as it increased the red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 compared with mpp - treated cultures .
the tq was similarly found to protect rat cortical neurons against ethanol- and a1 - 42-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22,23 counting of apoptotic nuclei using blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain indicated that tq decreased mpp - induced apoptotic cell death in primary mesencephalic cell cultures . in accordance ,
ullah et al22 reported that tq inhibited apoptotic cell death in ethanol - treated rat cortical neurons and attributed this effect of tq to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity .
zhang et al24 reported that mitochondrial clearance protected cultured cortical neurons against ischemia - reperfusion - induced cell damage . in conclusion , correlating such results would therefore suggest that tq might activate a lysosomal degradative process in dopaminergic neurons , where clearance of damaged mitochondria results in reduced mitochondria - mediated apoptotic cell death .
this might raise the possibility of using tq as a potentially therapeutic intervention in pd patients .
