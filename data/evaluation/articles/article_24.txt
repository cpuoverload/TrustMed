it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal 
 walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment .
therefore , it is critical the complete 
 sealing of the root canal system after cleaning and shaping in order to avoid the 
 bacterial penetration and re - infection of the root and periapical tissues .
the association of gutta - percha cones 
 and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose . however , in the last 
 decade , the dentin adhesive technology has been incorporated into the root canal filling 
 techniques to reduce apical and coronal leakage by bonding to root canal walls .
etch - and - rinse adhesives have been 
 tested with resin cements and the 
 combination of a dentin - bonding agent and an epoxy resin - based root canal sealer 
 significantly reduced apical leakage . in restorative dentistry , the self - etch adhesive systems have shown less technique 
 sensitivity , with reliable long - term performance of a two - step mild self - etch 
 adhesive . following this trend ,
pentron clinical technologies 
 ( wallingford , ct , usa ) has developed the epiphany system , which contains a self - etch 
 primer , a dual - cured composite resin sealer and a polyester - based thermoplastic 
 root - filling material ( resilon ; resilon research llc , madison , ct , usa ) . 
 according to shipper , et al .
( 2004 ) 
 this material has been shown to be more resistant to bacterial leakage than epoxy 
 resin - based sealers for filling root canals . in endodontics ,
the controversy about the performance of adhesive systems inside the 
 root canal remains . despite that , 
 other possibility is combining epiphany primer with ah plus in an attempt to add the 
 hybridization capacity to the gold standard endodontic sealer .
the reason for this is 
 that the removal of the smear layer with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) does 
 not provide the same etching pattern usually associated with the hybrid layer , which is 
 considered an important factor for dentin bonding .
the majority of studies have evaluated apical or coronal microleakage , and few have 
 focused gap formation at the dentin / sealer interface .
so far , no correlation between microleakage and gap 
 formation has been established in the literature .
thus , it is reasonable to believe that 
 the association of both methods would provide a more precise evaluation of the adhesive 
 interface .
the aim of this study was to compare the apical sealing and gap formation of ah 
 plus / gutta - percha with epiphany system .
in addition , the opportunity was taken to assess 
 the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha on apical 
 sealing and gap formation .
the null hypotheses tested were as follows : ( 1 ) there is no 
 difference in apical microleakage or ( 2 ) apical gap formation among the experimental 
 groups and ( 3 ) there is no correspondence between apical microleakage and the presence 
 of gaps .

 was removed with paper points .

gp = gutta - percha ; d = dentin ; r = resilon ) the data obtained for apical microleakage and types of gaps were statistically 
 analyzed ( =0.05 ) using the ordinal logistic regression model and correspondence analysis in the minitab statistical software 
 program ( minitab inc .
the counting of regions analyzed for gaps was also computed and adjusted in a 
 generalized linear model with poisson distribution and logarithmic link function .
the 
 sealers groups ( ah plus , ah primer and epiphany ) and the type of gap were considered 
 as explanatory variables and ah plus and the type 0 as references .
the ordinal logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there was no statistically 
 significant difference ( p>0.05 ) among the groups tested and types of gaps over 
 the logit of microleakage .
the model was adjusted to identify the 
 effect of the type of gap on microleakage .
the type 3 data were not considered isolated 
 in the analysis ( very few regions ) but joined with type 2 data ( figure 2c ; table 1 ) .
the 
 adjustment tests of the model presented high p - values for pearson 's test ( p=0.900 ) and 
 deviance ( p=0.852 ) .
the adjusted model demonstrated that the effect of the type of gap 
 on the logit of microleakage is significant when compared to the 
 presence of types 1 and 2 ( figure 2b and 2c , respectively ) of gap with the absence of gap 
 ( p=0.047 ) .
the correspondence analysis also showed the association between microleakage 
 and both types of apical gaps ( figure 3 ) .
correspondence analysis of microleakage vs. type of gap : ( inf.0 ) - absence of 
 leakage ; ( inf.1 ) - leakage up to the 1 millimeter ; ( inf.2 ) 
leakage 
 up to the 2 mm ; ( inf.3 )  leakage up to the 3 
 millimeter ; ( inf.5 )  leakage up to the 5 millimeter ; ( f.0 )  absence 
 of gaps ; ( f.1 )  gaps type 1 ; ( f.2 ) - gaps types 1 and 2 .
the absence of leakage 
 is associated with the absence of gap ; leakage up to the 1 millimeter 
 is associated with type 1 ; and more extensive leakage is associated with types 1 
 and 2 frequency and type of gaps in the apical 5 mm of root canal fillings percentage of regions with gaps .
type 0 : absence of gaps ; type 1 : gaps between 
 dentin and sealer ; type 2 gaps between sealer and cone the generalized linear model with poisson distribution ( table 1 ) found no difference between ah plus and ah primer ( p=0.497 ) in 
 distribution of each type of gap , but they presented more type 0 regions 
 ( p<0.001 ) .
there was a significant interaction between epiphany and the type of 
 gap ( p<0.003 ) and for this group , there were more type 1 regions .
based on the findings of this study , the first null hypothesis could not be rejected . 

recently some studies have shown similar results between ah plus and epiphany on apical 
 sealing ability using the fluid filtration method .
consistent with these 
 studies , our results indicate that the epiphany system is as effective as ah 
 plus / gutta - percha in preventing microleakage based on the chemical tracer penetration 
 analysis by sem and the use of epiphany primer does not reduce the microleakage of ah 
 plus . nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the 
 greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage 
 test , when compared to epoxy 
 resin - based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite .
these apparent discrepancies can perhaps be explained by the 
 methodology used and their variables .  
these results agree with those of previous studies in which , microleakage markers were 
 used to evaluate apical sealing of the same endodontic sealers .
the tracer 
 selected was agno3 , which may penetrate into dentinal tubules due to their 
 physical and chemical characteristics including : concentration , smaller molecular size , 
 its neutral ph , diffusion coefficient and service life up to 168 h post - preparation time of 
 solution .
another reason for 
 this choice is that metallic silver deposits may be observed by sem using back scattered 
 electrons ( bse ) mode . on the other hand ,
the results of the current study disagree with the findings of 
 shipper , et al .  
an 
 explanation for this would be that their studies have evaluated coronal and not apical 
 bacterial leakage . indeed , coronal seal might be favorably influenced by photoactivation 
 of the material which is unlikely to occur in the apical third .
furthermore , it is speculated that in in 
 vivo studies ( dogs ) , the high release of calcium hydroxide ( 41.46 mg / l ) that 
 would occur during the process of epiphany sealer solubilization , would make the medium 
 alkaline , resulting in acceleration of the periapical tissue repair process .
this study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or 
 sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage .
the epiphany group 
 presented more type 1 gaps than the other groups ( table 
 1 ) , rejecting the second null hypothesis .
these results corroborate with 
 previous observation of gaps in the apical 4 mm of epiphany or ah plus - filled root 
 canals .
stress generated 
 during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the 
 integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface .
in addition , the cavity configuration factor ( c - factor ) is 
 highly unfavorable for adhesion inside root canals .
moreover , it is known that analysis of gap formation of 
 vertically sectioned root filled teeth hides the risk of artifacts during sectioning . 

therefore , in this study , the sections were made at low speed under water cooling .
the 
 resin - epoxy replicas at the dentin / sealer and sealer / cone interfaces were made before 
 the specimens had been prepared for sem examination in order to differentiate genuine 
 gaps from artifactual gaps created after vacuum desiccation in conventional scanning 
 electron microscopes .
few studies have focused on apical sealing from two separate perspectives , such as 
 microleakage and apical gap formation .
sem was used to evaluate these perspectives , but it was restricted to a descriptive 
 approach .
a systematization of the observations , complemented by a statistical analysis , such as 
 the one performed in this study , could provide greater methodological accuracy and 
 impartiality for comparing the experimental groups .
the correspondence of analysis 
 between the types of gaps and linear extent of agno3 leakage ( fig .
3 ) confirms the effect of gaps on apical 
 microleakage , expressed by the silver deposition into gaps that extended deeply inside 
 dentinal tubules ( fig .
regarding to statistical analysis , the ordinal logistic regression analysis model was 
 used due to microleakage was considered categorized ordinal response variable ( ranging 
 from 0 - no leakage to 5 - leakage up to the fifth millimeter ) .
the correspondence 
 analysis is a method that leads to visualize the association between two categorical 
 variables , in this case microleakage and the type of gap .
the generalized linear model 
 with poisson which is an extension of usual regression model was performed to quantify 
 the distribution of types of gaps .
this result could be explained by two hypotheses : ( 1 ) 
 the low degree of conversion of the epiphany sealer and ( 2 ) the formation of hydrogel at the bond interface resulting 
 from the incomplete evaporation of the epiphany primer solvent .
the second hypothesis could also explain the inefficacy 
 of epiphany primer in improving the sealing capacity of ah plus .
moreover , there is a 
 chemical incompatibility between these two materials , since the epoxy resin sealers do 
 not copolymerize with methacrylate resin - based adhesives .
other studies should be carried out to clarify the 
 sealing ability of the root - filled materials studied .
it may be concluded that none of the tested materials completely sealed the apical 5 mm . 

the presence 
 of gaps had an effect on apical microleakage for all materials . comparing the materials , 
 epiphany system presented more regions containing gaps between the dentin and the sealer 
 ( type 1 ) . in view of these findings ,
clinically , it can be suggested that ah plus would 
 provide a better apical seal .
