this substitution is noteworthy because most strains characterized in 20032004 , including the fujian/411/2002 vaccine strain , contained a lysine ( k ) at this position .
prior to this outbreak , the us department of defense had only observed k145n substitutions in 6 strains obtained from ramstein , germany , ( data not shown ) in june 2004 .
additionally , all 26 nepal sequences exhibited a serine - to - asparagine substitution at position 189 ( s189n ) that had also been observed in the 6 isolates from germany , as well as in a few isolates from asia characterized at the end of the 20032004 influenza season .
two other substitution mutations in the ha1 hemagglutinin , i.e. , valine to isoleucine at position 226 ( v226i ) and serine to proline at position 227 ( s227p ) , were also observed in 24 ( 92% ) and 26 of 26 of the nepal isolates , respectively .

the 4 substitutions described represent a growing lineage of influenza a ( h3n2 ) viruses characterized since july 2004 .
three amino acid changes are confined within known antibody - binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season .
. this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) .
furthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation .
differences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) .
additionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible .
the 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level .
collectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) .
furthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera .
one explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity .
alternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report
, we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains .
three amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) .
phylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) .
studies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak .
the k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses .
cdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states .
the a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak .
the a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal .
all viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) .
most of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain .
these data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus .
our findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants .
